# agenda-server

This is the backend for my full-stack application, agenda. It was initially deployed to Heroku, but since Heroku removed their free-tier, I decided to push the backend
on github and deploy to Render.

The tools I used include: Node.js, Express.js, Cors, Body Parser, JsonWebtoken, and Bcrypt.
